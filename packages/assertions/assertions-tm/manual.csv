"thing-model-td-generation-processor-type","null","not testable with Assertion Tester","The tm:ThingModel value of the top-level @type MUST be removed in the Partial TD instance."
"tm-derivation-validity","null","not testable with Assertion Tester","When a Thing Descriptions is instantiated by relying on a Thing Model, it SHOULD be valid according to that Thing Model."
"tm-overwrite-interaction","null","not testable with Assertion Tester","A Thing Model SHOULD NOT overwrite the JSON names defined within the properties, actions, and/or events Map of the extended Thing Model."

"tm-tmRef-overwrite-process","null","not testable with Assertion Tester","The process to overwrite MUST follow the JSON Merge Patch algorithm as defined in [RFC7396] where the content of the referenced definition is patched with the new provided JSON name-value pairs."
