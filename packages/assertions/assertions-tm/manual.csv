"tm-td-generation-processor-forms","null","not testable with Assertion Tester","Missing communication and/or security metadata details MUST be completed in the Thing Description instance based on Section and/or ."
"tm-td-generation-processor-placeholder","null","not testable with Assertion Tester","If used, all placeholders (see Section ) in the Thing Model MUST be replaced with a valid corresponding value in the Partial TD."
"tm-td-generation-processor-required","null","not testable with Assertion Tester","All required interactions (not listed in tm:optional) MUST be taken over to the Partial TD instance."
"tm-derivation-validity","null","not testable with Assertion Tester","When a Thing Descriptions is instantiated by relying on a Thing Model, it SHOULD be valid according to that Thing Model."
"tm-overwrite-interaction","null","not testable with Assertion Tester","A Thing Model SHOULD NOT overwrite the JSON names defined within the properties, actions, and/or events Map of the extended Thing Model."
"tm-overwrite-types","null","not testable with Assertion Tester","Definitions SHOULD NOT be overwritten in such a way that possible instance values are no longer valid compared to the origin extended definitions."
"tm-placeholder-replacement","null","not testable with Assertion Tester","The placeholder labeling MUST be substituted with a concrete value (e.g., as JSON number, JSON string, JSON object, etc) when TD instance is created from the Thing Model."

"tm-tmRef-overwrite-semantic-meaning","null","not testable with Assertion Tester","Similar to tm:extends and to keep the semantic meaning, definitions SHOULD NOT be overwritten in such a way that possible instance values are no longer valid compared to the origin referenced definition."
